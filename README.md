My project can be found [here](https://dwain-daniel.github.io/Javascript-Milestone-Project-/)
 
 <h1>Milestone Project</h1>

This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far during the Full Stack Developer Course with Code Institute.  
I will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a memory game. The idea is to flip the cards
to find matching pairs of images. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices and is a clean and simple site to navigate around for users of all ages to enjoy

<h3>UX</h3>

I want my site to be quite minimalistic and simple whilst remaining effective. I have used bright colours and an attractive font to show the fun nature of the game.
The game is quite self explanatory, with only one clickable button outside of the game board. This is the reset button, this initialises the reshuffling of cards and the game begins again. 

### User Stories 

As a site user:

<li>I want a site that is easy to navigate through and to play a game that is fun and interactive</li>
<li>To be able to change the level of the game (easy, medium hard)</li>
<li>To be able to track my progress as I play with a running number of moves taken</li>
<li>To be able to see my results post game and how long I took to complete it and how many moves it took to complete the game</li>
<li>To easily be able to restart the game if I made too many mistakes or the time has reached too high a number</li>

As the site developer I would like the site to include:

<li>A timer for the user to see how long they are taking</li>
<li>A move counter for the user to track the amount of moves taken so far</li>
<li>An overlay to appear upon creation of the game giving the user feedback of the their game</li>

# Design process

The colours i have chosen are lawngreen, red and yellow. I have used these to make the page bright and attractive. The font I have used is 
Gloria Hallelujah, again this is in keeping with the fun and bright design I wanted to achieve.



<h3>Features</h3>

The user will see a running total of the amount of moves made with each click. The timer will also start from the second click on the screen. 
over.

Upon completion of the game an overlay will appear updating the user of the amount of moves used and time taken to complete the game.

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

I would like to add a number of features going forward such as: <br>
<li>Increased difficulty levels</li>
<li>Customisable colour schemes</li>


<h3> Technologies Used </h3>

I have built my site using: 

<h3>CSS</h3>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS 
CSS allows me to edit and decorate my site in the way I see fit. It gives me the ability to edit my HTML and create classes.

<h3>HTML</h3> 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML 

<h3>JavaScript</h3> 
https://www.javascript.com/

<h3>Balsamiq</h3> 
https://balsamiq.com/# 
I used Balsamiq to help create my template and try design a quality game. <img src="assets/balsamiq/balsamiq.pdf">

<h3>Google Fonts</h3> 
https://fonts.google.com/
Google fonts were used to import the 'Gloria Hallelujah' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<h3>Testing</h3> 

I have tested my site thoroughly, all the links are working and take the user to the correct pages.   
I placed my site throught a CSS Validator which returned no errors  

<h3>Deployment</h3>

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy the page using the following steps:

<li>I logged in to GitHub and located the GitHub Repository Milestone Project 1</li>
<li>I then clicked the Settings button on the menu.</li>
<li>I scrolled down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
<li>Under "Source" I selected "Master Branch".</li>
<li>The link was then published in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
